Here's a code written in C# programming language:
public class Student
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public int Grade { get; set; }
    public bool Exceptional { get; set; }
    public bool HonorRoll { get; set; }
    public bool Passed { get; set; }
}
 
public class StudentConverter
{
    public List<Student> ConvertStudents(List<Student> students)
    {
        return students.Select(student =>
        {
            var result = new Student
            {
                Name = student.Name,
                Age = student.Age,
                Grade = student.Grade
            };
 
            if (student.Grade > 90)
            {
                if (student.Age < 21)
                {
                    result.Exceptional = true;
                }
                else
                {
                    result.HonorRoll = true;
                }
            }
            else if (student.Grade > 70)
            {
                result.Passed = true;
            }
            else
            {
                result.Passed = false;
            }
 
            return result;
        }).ToList();
    }
}
Write unit tests for this code using xUnit framework, that will describe the following test cases:
1. Test case "High Achiever":
Given an array with a student object of age 21 or above and grade above 90, the function should return an object with the additional field HonorRoll = true.
2. Test case "Exceptional Young High Achiever":
Given an array with a student object of age less than 21 and grade above 90, the function should return an object with the additional field Exceptional = true.
3. Test case "Passed Student":
Given an array with a student object of grade between 71 and 90 (inclusive), the function should return an object with the additional field Passed = true.
4. Test case "Failed Student":
Given an array with a student object of grade 70 or less, the function should return an object with the additional field Passed = false.
5. Test case "Empty Array":
Given an empty array, the function should return an empty array.
6. Test case "Not an Array":
Given a null as an input the function should throw an error.

Here is a unit test class that should cover all the test cases you described. It uses the xUnit testing framework, which is a free, open-source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework. 

```csharp
using Xunit;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class StudentConverterTests
{
    private readonly StudentConverter _converter;

    public StudentConverterTests()
    {
        _converter = new StudentConverter();
    }

    [Fact]
    public void HighAchieverTest()
    {
        var students = new List<Student> { new Student { Age = 21, Grade = 91 } };
        var result = _converter.ConvertStudents(students);
        Assert.True(result[0].HonorRoll);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void ExceptionalYoungHighAchieverTest()
    {
        var students = new List<Student> { new Student { Age = 20, Grade = 91 } };
        var result = _converter.ConvertStudents(students);
        Assert.True(result[0].Exceptional);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void PassedStudentTest()
    {
        var students = new List<Student> { new Student { Age = 22, Grade = 80 } };
        var result = _converter.ConvertStudents(students);
        Assert.True(result[0].Passed);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void FailedStudentTest()
    {
        var students = new List<Student> { new Student { Age = 22, Grade = 70 } };
        var result = _converter.ConvertStudents(students);
        Assert.False(result[0].Passed);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void EmptyArrayTest()
    {
        var students = new List<Student>();
        var result = _converter.ConvertStudents(students);
        Assert.Empty(result);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void NotArrayTest()
    {
        Assert.Throws<ArgumentNullException>(() => _converter.ConvertStudents(null));
    }
}
```

Each [Fact] attribute indicates a test method that should be run by the test runner. For example, `HighAchieverTest` verifies that a student aged 21 or older with a grade above 90 is classified as HonorRoll. We use the Assert class methods to validate the conditions for each test. The `Assert.Throws<T>` method is used to validate that an exception of the specified type is thrown.

Here's a code written in C# programming language:
public class Player
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public int Experience { get; set; }
    public List<int> Skills { get; set; }
}
 
public class PlayerAnalyzer
{
    public double CalculateScore(List<Player> players)
    {
        double score = 0;
 
        foreach (var player in players)
        {
            double skillsAverage = player.Skills.Sum() / (double)player.Skills.Count;
            double contribution = player.Age * player.Experience * skillsAverage;
 
            if (player.Age < 18)
            {
                contribution *= 0.5;
            }
 
            if (player.Experience > 10)
            {
                contribution *= 1.2;
            }
 
            score += contribution;
        }
 
        return score;
    }
}
Write unit tests for this code using xUnit framework, that will describe the following test cases:
1. Test case "Normal Player":
Given an array with a single player object with age 25, experience 5 years, and skills [2, 2, 2], the function should return a score of 150 (since 2552 = 150).
2. Test case "Junior Player":
Given an array with a single player object with age 15, experience 3 years, and skills [3, 3, 3], the function should return a score of 67.5 (since (1533)*0.5 = 67.5).
3. Test case "Senior Player":
Given an array with a single player object with age 35, experience 15 years, and skills [4, 4, 4], the function should return a score of 1008 (since (35154)*1.2 = 1008).
4. Test case "Multiple Players":
Given an array with multiple player objects, the function should return the sum of their scores.
5. Test case "Skills is null":
Given an array with a player where Skills property is null, the function should throw an error.
6. Test case "Empty Array":
Given an empty array, the function should return 0 (since there are no players to contribute to the score).

Below are the xUnit test cases for the C# code that you provided. Note that this assumes you have imported the appropriate libraries for assertions and that your project references the xUnit framework.

csharp
Copy code
using Xunit;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System;

public class PlayerAnalyzerTests
{
    [Fact]
    public void NormalPlayerTest()
    {
        var player = new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = new List<int> { 2, 2, 2 } };
        var analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
        var score = analyzer.CalculateScore(new List<Player> { player });
        Assert.Equal(150, score);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void JuniorPlayerTest()
    {
        var player = new Player { Age = 15, Experience = 3, Skills = new List<int> { 3, 3, 3 } };
        var analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
        var score = analyzer.CalculateScore(new List<Player> { player });
        Assert.Equal(67.5, score);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void SeniorPlayerTest()
    {
        var player = new Player { Age = 35, Experience = 15, Skills = new List<int> { 4, 4, 4 } };
        var analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
        var score = analyzer.CalculateScore(new List<Player> { player });
        Assert.Equal(1008, score);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void MultiplePlayersTest()
    {
        var player1 = new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = new List<int> { 2, 2, 2 } };
        var player2 = new Player { Age = 35, Experience = 15, Skills = new List<int> { 4, 4, 4 } };
        var analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
        var score = analyzer.CalculateScore(new List<Player> { player1, player2 });
        Assert.Equal(1158, score); // 150 from player1 and 1008 from player2
    }

    [Fact]
    public void SkillsIsNullTest()
    {
        var player = new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = null };
        var analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
        Assert.Throws<NullReferenceException>(() => analyzer.CalculateScore(new List<Player> { player }));
    }

    [Fact]
    public void EmptyArrayTest()
    {
        var analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
        var score = analyzer.CalculateScore(new List<Player>());
        Assert.Equal(0, score);
    }
}
Please note that the Assert.Equal method in xUnit uses an epsilon to compare two double numbers. The epsilon value is 1E-14, so two numbers that differ by less than 0.00000000000001 are considered equal. If you need more precision, you need to use Assert.True with an explicit comparison.

Also, be aware that the SkillsIsNullTest is expecting a NullReferenceException to be thrown by your CalculateScore method. If this is not the exception thrown in your method, you need to change it accordingly.

Me:

I've changed the code a little bit, so now it throws a NullReferenceException, if Skills property is null. Now the code looks like this:
public class Player
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }
        public int Experience { get; set; }
        public List<int> Skills { get; set; }
    }

    public class PlayerAnalyzer
    {
        public double CalculateScore(List<Player> players)
        {
            double score = 0;

            foreach (var player in players)
            {
                if (player.Skills is null)
                {
                    throw new NullReferenceException();
                }

                double skillsAverage = player.Skills.Sum() / (double)player.Skills.Count;
                double contribution = player.Age * player.Experience * skillsAverage;

                if (player.Age < 18)
                {
                    contribution *= 0.5;
                }

                if (player.Experience > 10)
                {
                    contribution *= 1.2;
                }

                score += contribution;
            }

            return score;
        }
    }
Some of the tests, that you've written are failing. These tests are NormalPlayerTest, SeniorPlayerTest, MultiplePlayersTest.
NormalPlayerTest is failing with the next message:
Assert.Equal() Failure
Expected: 150
Actual:   250
SeniorPlayerTest is failing with the next massege:
Assert.Equal() Failure
Expected: 1008
Actual:   2520
MultiplePlayersTest is failing with the next message:
Assert.Equal() Failure
Expected: 1158
Actual:   2770
Edit these three tests in a way so they don't fail

ChatGPT:

It looks like the calculations in your test expectations are incorrect. Let's correct them:

Normal Player: The average of skills [2, 2, 2] is 2. Thus, the contribution is 25 * 5 * 2 = 250.
Senior Player: The average of skills [4, 4, 4] is 4. Thus, the contribution is 35 * 15 * 4 = 2100. With an experience greater than 10 years, this value is multiplied by 1.2, giving 2520.
Multiple Players: The score of the Normal Player is 250 and the score of the Senior Player is 2520. So, the total score is 250 + 2520 = 2770.
Here are the corrected tests:

csharp
Copy code
[Fact]
public void NormalPlayerTest()
{
    var player = new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = new List<int> { 2, 2, 2 } };
    var analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
    var score = analyzer.CalculateScore(new List<Player> { player });
    Assert.Equal(250, score);
}

[Fact]
public void SeniorPlayerTest()
{
    var player = new Player { Age = 35, Experience = 15, Skills = new List<int> { 4, 4, 4 } };
    var analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
    var score = analyzer.CalculateScore(new List<Player> { player });
    Assert.Equal(2520, score);
}

[Fact]
public void MultiplePlayersTest()
{
    var player1 = new Player { Age = 25, Experience = 5, Skills = new List<int> { 2, 2, 2 } };
    var player2 = new Player { Age = 35, Experience = 15, Skills = new List<int> { 4, 4, 4 } };
    var analyzer = new PlayerAnalyzer();
    var score = analyzer.CalculateScore(new List<Player> { player1, player2 });
    Assert.Equal(2770, score); // 250 from player1 and 2520 from player2
}
These test cases should now pass if the logic in your PlayerAnalyzer class is correct.
